# NodeJS - Vite + TypeScript Example

A sample for NodeJS that showcases getter and setter [Juno](https://juno.build) Datastore and Storage in TypeScript with the help of vite.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/junobuild/examples
cd examples/node/vite-typescript
npm ci
```

## Local development

> Make sure you have Juno's CLI installed: `npm i -g @junobuild/cli`

From the root of this project, start the local development environment:

```bash
juno dev start
```

Then, to interact with the Datastore, run:

```bash
npm run docs
```

Or with the storage:

```bash
npm run assets
```
