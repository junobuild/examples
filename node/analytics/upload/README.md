# Node.js - Analytics - Upload

A Node.js script to upload page views collected from [Juno](https://juno.build) Analytics.

This script is useful if you have gathered data and want to upload it in your developer environment.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org) LTS installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/junobuild/examples
cd examples/node/analytics/upload
npm ci
```

## Configuration

Configure your Orbiter ID in [.env](.env).

- `JUNO_ORBITER_ID`: the Orbiter ID from which you want to gather data

## Upload Page Views

Use the following command to upload page views.

The `--path` argument must point to a folder containing data formatted similarly to the output generated by the "collect" script.

The script will process all files in the specified folder.

```bash
npm run upload -- --path ./output
```
